Abstract: Sustainable supply chain policies aim to decouple food production from environmentally
destructive practices, including via commitments to eliminate deforestation. Despite mixed
evidence regarding their effectiveness, the adoption of these “zero-deforestation
commitments” (ZDCs) has grown steadily, particularly in high deforestation-risk sectors like
the Brazilian cattle industry. We provide the first spatially explicit estimates of the market
share of ZDC cattle companies, using the three Brazilian states that collectively constitute
75% of the cattle herd and 80% of deforestation in the Legal Amazon region. We then
evaluate the relationship between increases in market share and municipal-level deforestation
to assess whether commitments are more effective where committed companies have higher
market penetration. Our analysis shows that an increase in the market shares of companies
with ZDCs is associated with lower municipal-level deforestation. These results indicate that
the effectiveness of supply chain commitments in reducing deforestation is contingent on
high participation rates, otherwise opportunities for producers to avoid or evade committed
companies remain high
