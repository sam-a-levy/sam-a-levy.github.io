Abstract: Deforestation and forest degradation are key influences on climate change, accounting for 17% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In this session, we will learn about what drives unsustainable forest management and how machine learning can enable us to better protect, manage, and restore our world’s forests.

Presentation was given remotely and jointly with Dr. Janina Grabs
