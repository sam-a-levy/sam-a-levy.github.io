I am a postdoctoral researcher at New York University's [Department of Environmental Studies](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/environment.html). 

I received my PhD in Development Economics from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was a member of the [Environmental Policy Lab](https://epl.ethz.ch/) and hold an MSc in Environmental Change & Management from the University of Oxford and a BA in Social Anthropology from the University of Cambridge. I have interdisciplinary training in economics, geography, environmental science, and anthropology and use a range of research methods and designs, including statistical models and case studies.

My work focuses on understanding the effectiveness and equity of environmental policies, particularly those seeking to govern tropical deforestation. In my research I have advanced understanding regarding the [theoretical basis for effective zero-deforestation commitments](https://sam-a-levy.github.io/publication/2019-CriteriaZDC), as well as conducted [qualitative](https://sam-a-levy.github.io/publication/2022-CattleZDC) and [quantitative](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3988688) analyses of forest-focused private environmental policies in the Brazilian Amazon. Currently, in addition to expanding my previous work on zero-deforestation commitments, I am investigating the conservation impacts of Indigenous Lands in Indonesia.

My PhD thesis is available [here](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000539299)
