I am a Science & Policy Specialist at the [Accountability Framework initiative](https://accountability-framework.org/) and [Rainforest Alliance](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/). 

In my current role, I lead and support the Accountability Framework initiative's workstreams related to improved supply chain policies in non-forest ecosystems, improving the supply chain theory of change, and lead on our South America strategy. My role requires me to conduct research, engage partners and key stakeholders across the globe, as well as communicate project findings in forms varying from academic publications to short-form blogs and presentations.  

I received my PhD in Development Economics from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was a member of the [Environmental Policy Lab](https://epl.ethz.ch/). I also hold an MSc in Environmental Change & Management from the University of Oxford and a BA in Social Anthropology from the University of Cambridge. I have interdisciplinary training in economics, geography, environmental science, and anthropology and in my research I use a range of methods and designs, including statistical models and case studies. Prior to my current position, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [New York University's Department of Environmental Studies](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/environment.html).

My work focuses on understanding the effectiveness and equity of environmental policies, particularly those seeking to govern the conversion of native vegetation, such as forests and savannahs. In my research I have advanced understanding regarding the [theoretical basis for effective zero-deforestation commitments](https://sam-a-levy.github.io/publication/2019-CriteriaZDC), as well as conducted [qualitative](https://sam-a-levy.github.io/publication/2022-CattleZDC) and [quantitative](https://sam-a-levy.github.io/publication/2023-MarketShare) analyses of forest-focused private environmental policies in the Brazilian Amazon. 

My PhD thesis is available [here](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000539299).
